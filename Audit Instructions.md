Start by installing the latest version of Next.js (not v13 as in the course). Identify any issues caused by updates, library changes, or deprecated APIs.

As we get started with this course, I wanted to let you know that I've created a GitHub
repository for the playground project we'll be using throughout the course. You can find
the repository at:

https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/next-course

https://forum.codewithmosh.com/

This repository contains all of the example code and exercise solutions that I'll be
showing throughout the course. This way, if you ever get stuck or want to compare
your code to mine, you can easily access all of the code examples and solutions in one
place. Happy coding!
